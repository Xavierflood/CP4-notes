The first line of your code must be <!DOCTYPE html>.
To code, you must have <html> code </html>. This means that the browser can easily interpret your code.
The <head> contains information that you can't see right away.
To close it, you put </head>.
The <title> tag allows you to put a title at the beginning of the page. You must close it with </title>.
To display something on the actual page, you need to use a <body>. </body>
A <br /> tag allows you to break the line. You only need one tag for this one.
HTML uses a family type system, where the tags of one part are inside the tags of another part, they will be called parent and child.
Coders use whitespace and indentation to not get confused with which codes are related to each other. It also makes it easier to read. 
<!-- To start a comment, you put the symbol at the beginning of this sentence. To close one, you put this symbol. -->
Comments allow you to understand your code and to experiment with other code.
Headings are started with <h1> and they get smaller with the higher number you get. </h2> For example, a heading <h2> will make the words smaller than the words in </h1>. 
<p> Paragraphs allow you to write long pieces of text. Close it with </p>.
<div> Allows you to put text or divide parts of a code into sections. Close it with </div>.
<span> Allows you to insert smaller pieces of text to wrap code on the same line. Close it with </span>.
<em> tags allow you to emphasize your text to make it italic. Close it with </em>
<strong> tags allow you to make your text stronger, or bold it. Close it with </strong>
A <ul> tag allows you to make a list without a particular order. </ul> The <li> tag gives a description of the item in a list. You can't have a list without </li>.
An <ol> tag allows you to make a list with an order. </ol> Again, you need <li>. Close it with </li>
The <img> tag allows you to insert an image into your text. You also need an src (source) to be able to identify where the image is coming from.
Attributes give you more information about the element. 
The alt attribute allows you to give a description of the image, and to make it easier for the visually imapired to understand the image by reading it aloud to them.
The video tag is very similar but the only difference is that you need an opening and closing tag.
The <a> function allows you to give an introduction to the link you're going to insert. Close it with </a>. You cannot have that without a href attribute, which is the actual link.
You can turn an image into a link by wrapping the <img> tag with an <a> tag. Close it with </a>.
To open a link in a new window, you must add a target attribute. The target attribute must be _blank.
To add a link on the same page, put ./contact.html. It is a relative path that leads you to the contact file in the same folder. 
An id is a description of your link. Put one in an unordered list to make a list of links.
The <nav> tag allows you to navigate through your links and keep them organized. Close it with </nav>.
The <table> tag allows you to make a table and everything inside the tag is contained inside the table. Close it with </table>.
The <tr> tag allows you to add a row to your table. Close it with </tr>.
Cells containing data can be made using the <td> tag. Close it with </td>.
A <th> tag allows you to put a heading into your table to identify the data. Close it with </th>.
Scope="col" can be used to identify a column heading.
Scope="row" can be used to identify a column heading.
A border makes your table easier to read and look better.
The colspan attribute alternates the amount of columns data spans across.
The rowspan does a similar thing but it's for data that spans across multiple rows.

CSS:

CSS allows you to style your website to your liking. 
Inline styling allows you to input code within an html document.
Place a <style> element inside the <head> element. This allows you to style multiple headings. </style>, </head>
a style.css file allows you to separate your html code from your css code, with two different files.
For your html code to locate your css code, you need to link them together. Use the <link> element. </link>. You also need a href, rel, and type, to specify it.
A css selector allows you to select all the code that corresponds to that tag. The tag is the letter in the angle brackets, without those brackets, from html.
You can also select code using the class attribute. If the class is set to brand, we will use the attribute .brand.
If an element needs two or more attributes, you can add multiple classes to an element's class attribute by separating them with a space.
An id allows you to style your code uniquely without referring to the class. 
An id overrides the class and tag element, making it essential to only use it when elements need to appear the same.
Id selectors, class selectors, and tag selectors make it much easier for you to edit codes with multiple tags, classes, and IDs.
Chaining means to have multiple selectors in the same element. 
We can select multiple elements that are nested in other elements .mainlist li selects the items in the mainlist (unordered list).
The more tags, classes and ID's you add, the more specific it gets.
!important is even more specific than ID's. It should almost never be used because it will be hard to override.
Making CSS code more concise is easy and avoids repetitive code. Just separate the selectors with a comma.
A CSS rule consists of a selector and all declarations inside of it. A declaration consists of a property and a value.
The font-family is also known as the typeface. Default typeface is Times New Roman. 
Modifying the size of your text can also be useful. Px stands for pixels and is the unit for measuring font size.
Font-weight allows you to decide how much bold you want in your text. 
Text align allows you to align your text to the left, center, or right.
Foreground color is the color that the element appears in.
Background color is the background of the heading. 
Opacity is the amount of transparency in an element. 
You can make the background of your webpage an image by using background-image. You need to provide a value to it, a url that leads to an image.
The box model is essentially code "living" inside a box.
The box model contains the elements width and height, padding, border, and margin.
CSS height and width components can be used to edit the box's dimensions.
Borders are lines surrounding elements. They can be set with a width, style, and color.
Border-radius code allows you to alter the corners of the border.
Padding is the space between the border and the contents. You can change it to make your box less cramped. 
You can simplify your code to set exactly how much padding you want on each side. Write four numbers, and they correspond to a clockwise rotation: top, right, bottom, left.
Margin is the space directly outside the box. 
The simplification of margin is the same as padding. Write four numbers that correspond to top right bottom and left in clockwise rotation.
The auto component is used to center your element.
Min-width and max-width allow you to make your box a minimum size and a maximum size. You can also adjust the height of your paragraph with min-height and max-height.
The total dimensions are found when you add the vertical dimensions and the horizontal dimensions together.
Overflow: hidden hides the code that's overflowing from view.
Overflow: scroll allows you to put a scroll bar so that you can access the code by scrolling.
Overflow: visible id default. The code will be displayed outside.
User agent stylesheets have default rules. To reset the values to work with a clean slate, set everything to 0.
Visibility: hidden hides an element.
Visibility: visible displays an element. 
Border-box keeps the values of the height and width the same, without adding margins and borders, keeping it simple for coders.
