CSS allows you to style your website to your liking. 
Inline styling allows you to input code within an html document.
Place a <style> element inside the <head> element. This allows you to style multiple headings. </style>, </head>
a style.css file allows you to separate your html code from your css code, with two different files.
For your html code to locate your css code, you need to link them together. Use the <link> element. </link>. You also need a href, rel, and type, to specify it.
A css selector allows you to select all the code that corresponds to that tag. The tag is the letter in the angle brackets, without those brackets, from html.
You can also select code using the class attribute. If the class is set to brand, we will use the attribute .brand.
If an element needs two or more attributes, you can add multiple classes to an element's class attribute by separating them with a space.
An id allows you to style your code uniquely without referring to the class. 
An id overrides the class and tag element, making it essential to only use it when elements need to appear the same.
Id selectors, class selectors, and tag selectors make it much easier for you to edit codes with multiple tags, classes, and IDs.
Chaining means to have multiple selectors in the same element. 
We can select multiple elements that are nested in other elements .mainlist li selects the items in the mainlist (unordered list).
